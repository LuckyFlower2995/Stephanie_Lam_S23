Trapped Sheep

The sheep is stuck in a maze, very scared of its surroundings. The sheep is so scared that if it even touches the wall, it will run back to its corner.

The goal is to get out of the maze without touching the walls. Be very careful, as the sheep is very sensitive.

Controls:
	Left Arrow - move the sheep to the left
	Right Arrow - move the sheep to the right
	Up Arrow - move the sheep up
	Down Arrow - move the sheep down

Enjoy!
